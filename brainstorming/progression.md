Tiers 1-5 (Material-Based Progression)

    Manual Labor & Simple Automation – Players gather resources, refine materials, and craft items by hand or with basic machines (like forges, smelters, and mills).
    Unlocking New Tech by Discovery – Progression happens organically by finding ores, unlocking recipes, and improving tools.
    Limited Experimentation – Basic trial-and-error crafting, similar to early Minecraft but with more structured tech dependencies.
    No Formal Research System Yet – Advancements are tied directly to material access and crafted structures.

Tier 6 (Silicon Age – Research System Introduced)

    Research Labs & Tech Trees – Players must build research stations and generate "research points" through experimentation, data collection, or automated production.
    Factorio-Style Research – Requires different resources (silicon, circuits, experimental data, etc.) to unlock new technologies.
    Diverging Tech Paths – Players might need to choose between different advancements (e.g., prioritizing automation vs material science vs. space travel).
    Automation Becomes Essential – Players transition from manual labor to factory-scale production chains to support research.
    Digital Infrastructure – Introduction of computing systems and logistics management (automated storage, smart conveyor systems, etc.).

Tiers 7-9 (Science-Driven Progression)

    Research Becomes the Main Progression Mechanic – Advancements rely less on finding materials and more on experimental science.
    Specialized Research Facilities – Labs for composites, nanotechnology, space travel.
    Large-Scale Industrialization – Orbital factories, automated space mining, and planetary colonization require a robust research-backed economy.
    High-Tech Logistics – Players must optimize production lines with intelligent automation (logistics drones?, robotic assembly, etc.).
    Experimentation & Discovery Mechanics – Players could engage in simulated scientific research (e.g., testing new materials, running experiments to discover new properties).


Tier 6 (Silicon Age – Material-Based Research)

    Basic Research Stations – Research labs consume crafted materials (e.g., silicon wafers, circuits, experimental alloys) to generate research points.
    Prototype Testing – Some machines or structures require real-world testing before mass production.
    Material-Based Science Packs (Factorio-style) – Research consumes specific materials like advanced metals, plastics, and chemicals.
    Early Computational Needs – Some research might need primitive computing (single processors, early data storage).

Tier 7 (Composites – Blended Material & Compute-Based Research)

    Hybrid Research Approach – Still requires materials, but research now benefits from computing power (early supercomputers).
    Simulation-Driven Testing – Some experiments can be replaced with digital simulations, reducing material waste.
    Quantum Science & Theoretical Research – Unlocks physics-based advancements requiring massive data processing.
    Distributed Computing – Players may need to build computing clusters to handle complex calculations.

Tier 8+ (Metamaterials & Nanomaterials – Compute-Dominant Research)

    Compute Becomes the Main Bottleneck – Research is almost entirely simulation-based, requiring massive computing power.
    Supercomputers – Large data centers optimize discovery, with more advanced processors accelerating research speeds.
    Exotic Physics & Reality Manipulation – Some research requires extreme computing power to model high-energy physics or quantum effects.
    Virtual Labs & Digital Prototyping – New materials or designs can be tested in simulated environments before physical production.

Implementation Ideas:

    Experimental Prototyping:
        Some technologies (like fission reactors, fusion power, or space propulsion systems) require a working prototype before unlocking full-scale production.
        The prototype may be inefficient, unstable, or dangerous but must be built and tested to unlock improved versions.

    Physical Research Facilities:
        Metallurgical Testing: Tensile Tests and RBFT required for unlocked more advanced metallic materials (Ni Superalloys, etc)
        Particle Accelerators: Required for unlocking advanced physics (e.g., antimatter, quantum mechanics, and metamaterials).
        Experimental Reactors: Players must build and run small-scale fission/fusion reactors before developing commercial-grade power plants.
        Zero-G Research Labs: Required for studying materials in microgravity, a prerequisite for advanced space-age technologies.
        Space Observatories: Necessary for high-energy astrophysics, gravitational research, and FTL-related studies (if applicable).

    Failure & Risk Mechanics:
        Proof-of-concept research might come with risks (e.g., reactor meltdowns, plasma instabilities, containment failures).
        Players could have to mitigate safety hazards—shielding, cooling, and controlled test environments.
        Experiments could fail randomly or based on preparation level, requiring multiple tests before success.

    Data Collection & Analysis:
        Experimental facilities generate raw data that must be analyzed using compute power before finalizing tech unlocks.
        Some experiments might need multiple tests to build confidence in a design (e.g., repeated collider runs for discovering new particles).
